                             \\==================//

I never thaught I would actually succeed in making my own items, let alone my
own item upgrade mod to implement them. But I've managed to do it, although it
did take some time, a lot of hard work, and help from a very experienced person
(Weimer) to get me there.


Hope you guys (and girls) enjoy it.

                             \\==================//

This mod runs on BGII SoA with or without ToB installed, and should work with
all other WeiDU mods.

1 - Extract the main EXE file into your BGII main directory.
    e.g. "C:\Games\Baldurs Gate II"

2 - Run "Setup-Ruad.exe".

3 - Choose which components you would like to install.

You can uninstall any component later by re-running "Setup-Ruad.exe".

                          | 1: Ruad Ro'fhessa  (SoA) |
                          \--------------------------/

Ruad is a brand new blacksmith who forges item upgrades, as well as a few brand
new items.

I won't spoil his location for you, but I will tell that he is near the
Adventurer's Mart.

Read SPOILERS-Ruad.txt for his exact location, and a complete list of items and
descriptions.

                          /--------------------------\
                          | 2: Ruad Ro'fhessa  (ToB) |
                          \--------------------------/

This makes Ruad ToB compatable, and puts him in your Pocket Plane.

None (yet).
